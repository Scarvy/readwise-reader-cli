        "content": "Pragmatism is a philosophical approach that emphasizes practicality and usefulness over abstract theories or principles. It originated in the United States in the late 19th century and was developed by philosophers such as William James and John Dewey. Pragmatists believe that the value of an idea or belief lies in its ability to solve problems and improve people's lives. They emphasize experimentation, observation, and experience as the basis for knowledge and reject the idea of absolute truth or certainty. Pragmatism has had a significant influence on American culture and has been applied in fields such as education, politics, and business.",

It tells them when something is wrong with the code and helps them figure out what caused the problem. Sentry can also track the health of different parts of the program and can help find the root cause of issues. This is important because programs are becoming more complex and it's harder for developers to keep track of everything. With Sentry, developers can make sure the program is working properly and giving customers a good experience.",
